# Code Refactor Starter Code

* AS A marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

* This webpage meets accessibility standards
when I view the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements.
When I view the structure of the HTML elements, then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
When I view the image elements, then I find accessible alt attributes.
When I view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order.
When I view the title element, then I find a concise, descriptive title.

## Assets-
<!-- *Insured all links functioned properly.-->
<!-- *Insured all css selectors follow semantic structure.-->
<!-- *Ensured the structure of the code followed a logical sequence.-->
<!-- *Added alt attributes for images.-->
<!-- *Confirmed all headings H1 through H3 were in sequential or logical order.-->
<!-- *Changed the title so that it was represenative of the webpage content.-->
<!-- *Added comments to the css file to ensure a better refactor experience in the future.-->
<!-- *Combined all similar css codes to reduse the css file-->
